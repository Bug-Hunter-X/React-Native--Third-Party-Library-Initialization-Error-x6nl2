This error occurs when using a third-party library that hasn't been properly integrated into your React Native project, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Specifically, it happens when the library's components or functions are called before they are fully initialized or available. This can manifest in different ways, such as a blank screen, a crash, or unexpected values being returned.
