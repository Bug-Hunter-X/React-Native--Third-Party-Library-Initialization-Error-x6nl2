# React Native Third-Party Library Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving the improper initialization of third-party libraries.  The bug occurs when attempting to use a library's functionality before it has been fully initialized within the React Native environment. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `ThirdPartyLibBug.js` file showcases the buggy code, while `ThirdPartyLibSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected implementation.  The solution involves ensuring the library is properly initialized before usage, which may involve asynchronous operations and error handling.
